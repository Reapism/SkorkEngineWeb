# Skork Engine by Anthony J (Reapism)
**Skork Engine** is the sequel to the original [Skork](https://github.com/Reapism/Skork) project.

**Skork** (SCORE-K) is a custom programming language for writing a game with rules *you define*. Skork allows you to test code in a 
visual way using *sprites*. You can visual your code using primitive variables, loops, and sprites. My audience is anyone 
interested enough to write in a simplified programming language, and visualize code in a different way! Feel free to fork it 
and make any update/addition/deletion you want.

## All Skork related projects.
Three distinct projects! 
* **Windows based GUI implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.**
* *Skork Engine framework itself! (private)*
* *Web based implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.* (COMING SOON)
This is the GUI focused implementation of the Skork Engine framework. There is also a web based implementation of the Skork
framework. This will be slowly developed overtime! 


# FAQ 
### Is the Skork engine open sourced?
This project itself is open sourced. This refers to the GUI of the Skork Engine, and the interaction with the Skork-Engine 
framework. The actual Skork framework is **not open sourced** at this time. Since the rebirth of this project, I decided to
go for a large database route and also focus most on the implementation of the framework.

### What is the Skork Engine framework?
It's the barebones API for parsing text into code, compiling it, interpreting it, and running it! As mentioned above, this
project is an **implementation** of the Skork framework.

### What is Skork Engine used for?
Since its a programming language, technically, its uses are up to you. What makes this simplified programming language
different than the others is that it is revolved around sprites which are a visual indicator of the code. You can create
a "game" with a ruleset you define statically or dynamically through code. It provides an easy way to visualize a ruleset
or function.

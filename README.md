**Skork Engine** is the sequel to the original [Skork](https://github.com/Reapism/Skork) project.

## What is the Skork Engine
**Skork** (SCORE-K) is a custom programming language for writing a game with rules *you define*. Skork allows you to test code in a 
visual way using *sprites*. You can visual your code using primitive variables, loops, and sprites. My audience is anyone 
interested enough to write in a simplified programming language, and visualize code in a different way! Feel free to fork it 
and make any update/addition/deletion you want.

## All Skork related projects.
Three distinct projects! 
* **Windows based GUI implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.**
* *Skork Engine framework itself! (private)*
* *Web based implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.* (COMING SOON)
There is also a web based implementation of the Skork framework. This will be slowly developed overtime!

# FAQ 
### Is the Skork engine open sourced?
This project itself is open sourced. This refers to the GUI of the Skork Engine, and the interaction with the Skork-Engine 
framework. The actual Skork framework is **not open sourced**. Since the rebirth of this project, I decided this project
fits better with a cloud computing model. This means all profiles, preferences, (possibly) and projects will be in the cloud.
An emphasis on a database model for this software means that database connectivity, and manipulation *shouldn't* be public (for
security reasons).

### What is the Skork Engine framework?
It's the barebones API for parsing text into code, compiling it, interpreting it, and running it! The Skork framework 
delegates a certain number of resources based on the priortity of each task or instruction. This project is an 
**implementation** of the framework. The compiled framework will be available for use with its own license.

### What is Skork Engine used for?
Since its a programming language, technically, its uses are up to you. What makes this simplified programming language
different than the others is that it is revolved around **sprites** which are a visual indicator of your code. Writing code
around these sprites will enable you to visualize your code. Overtime, there will be other **"entities"** you can instantiate
and interact with! You can create a "game" with a ruleset you define statically or dynamically through code. It provides an
easy way to visualize a ruleset
or function.
